ldesc: "The binary I/O stream class library presents a platform-
independent way to access binary data streams in C++. The library is hardware
independent in the form that it transparently converts between the different
forms of machine-internal binary data representation. It further employs no
special I/O protocol and can be used on arbitrary binary data sources."
