sdesc: "JPEG library with SIMD acceleration for Win64 toolchain"
ldesc: "libjpeg-turbo is a derivative of libjpeg that uses SIMD
instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression
and decompression on x86, x86-64, and ARM systems.  On such systems,
libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-4x as fast as the unmodified version of
libjpeg, all else being equal."
