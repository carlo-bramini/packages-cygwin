ldesc: "This package contains the libnsl library. This library contains the
public client interface for NIS(YP) and NIS+.  This code was formerly part of
glibc, but is now standalone to be able to link against TI-RPC for IPv6 support.
The NIS(YP) functions are still maintained, the NIS+ part is deprecated and
should not be used anymore."
